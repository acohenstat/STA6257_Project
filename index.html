<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and extracting named entities from unstructured text. NER presents challenges due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of natural language. Still, it is essential for various NLP applications, including information retrieval, question answering, and machine translation. Biomedical NER is the task of text mining to specifically biomedical texts to determine entity types <span class="citation" data-cites="xiong2021Improving">(<a href="#ref-xiong2021Improving" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>xiong2021Improving?</strong></a>)</span>. Similarly, medical NER tasks usually find the boundaries of mentions from medical texts <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhao_Liu_Zhao_Wang_2019">(<a href="#ref-Zhao_Liu_Zhao_Wang_2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Zhao_Liu_Zhao_Wang_2019?</strong></a>)</span>. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated exceptional performance in NER tasks in recent years. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks to learn from data and make predictions.</p>
<p>The Transformer model, introduced in 2017, has become a fundamental architecture in modern NLP and is widely used for NER tasks. It is known for its self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in the input sequence. Additionally, other deep learning architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have been successfully applied to NER.</p>
<p>In this literature review, we will explore and compare the effectiveness of RNNs and the Transformer model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.</p>
<section id="recurrent-neural-networks-rnn" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recurrent-neural-networks-rnn">1.1 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h2>
<p>A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a method of deep learning that is useful for sequential data and time-series data. RNNs are often used in ordinal problems, where the output is discrete and ordered, as well as temporal problems, in which the time that data is collected is important. These problems include speech recognition, language translation, and natural language processing (NLP). RNNs are similar to other neural networks, but they have some distinct differences. Other neural network models can be used for medical text mining, however, RNNs have been shown to be one of the most effective models. This model has some drawbacks, but they can be mitigated with the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells in the hidden layers of the neural network <span class="citation" data-cites="Wu_Jiang_Xu_Zhi_Xu2018ClinicalNER">(<a href="#ref-Wu_Jiang_Xu_Zhi_Xu2018ClinicalNER" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Wu_Jiang_Xu_Zhi_Xu2018ClinicalNER?</strong></a>)</span>. RNNs have the ability to allow information to persist across multiple steps which enables the network to capture dependencies and context. This is a feature that makes it ideal for NER in which the context is very important. The specifics of a recurrent neural network will be discussed later</p>
</section>
<section id="transformer-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformer-model">1.2 Transformer Model</h2>
<p>The Transformer model is a groundbreaking neural network architecture introduced in the paper “Attention Is All You Need” <span class="citation" data-cites="vaswani2017attention">(<a href="#ref-vaswani2017attention" role="doc-biblioref">Vaswani et al. 2017</a>)</span>. ​The model is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, and is known for its ability to process input sequences in parallel rather than sequentially. This parallel processing makes the Transformer model highly efficient and scalable. One of the key innovations of the Transformer model is the self-attention mechanism. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence relative to each other when making predictions. The model uses multi-head attention, which means it can simultaneously attend to various input aspects. This ability to capture complex dependencies and relationships between words contributes to the model’s strong performance. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and decoder, each composed of multiple layers of self-attention and feed forward neural networks. The encoder processes the input sequence while the decoder generates the output sequence. The connections between the encoder and decoder are facilitated by attention mechanisms that allow the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence as it generates the output. Given its effectiveness and efficiency in handling sequence data, the Transformer model has become the foundation for many subsequent natural language processing (NLP) models and architectures.</p>

<section id="limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">1.3 Limitations</h2>
<p>A major limitation of current techniques is that the standard language models are unidirectional, and thus limit the choice of architecture that can be used for pre-training <span class="citation" data-cites="devlin2019bert">(<a href="#ref-devlin2019bert" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>devlin2019bert?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Transformers are powerful neural network models commonly used in natural language processing tasks. However, they face two fundamental limitations: First, their large number of parameters results in high computational complexity, necessitating specialized hardware and substantial resources, especially for deep models with long input sequences. Second, transformers exhibit quadratic time complexity concerning input length due to the self-attention mechanism, which calculates attention scores between all token pairs. This quadratic complexity limits transformers’ ability to handle very long sequences efficiently. Researchers actively explore methods to mitigate these limitations and improve the scalability of transformers.<span class="citation" data-cites="keles2022computational">(<a href="#ref-keles2022computational" role="doc-biblioref">Keles, Wijewardena, and Hegde 2022</a>)</span></p>

<section id="methods" class="level1">
<h1><strong>2 Methods</strong></h1>
<section id="rnn" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rnn">2.1 RNN</h2>
<p>A neural network has three layers. An input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. A recurrent neural network (RNN) also has three layers, but with the addition of a recurrent component that takes the output from a previous iteration and includes it in the current iteration. This is what makes RNNs useful for sequential and temporal data. Basic neural networks are optimized using back propagation which involves finding the gradient of a parameter and then using a gradient descent algorithm to find values that minimize a loss function (such as error).</p>
<p>Example of Loss function (Mean Squared Error)<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{L(𝜽)} = (1/N) * ∑(y_i - y_i^*)^2\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>Gradient Descent Algorithm<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{𝜽}_j =𝜽_j - 𝛼 (∂J(𝜽) / ∂𝜽_j)\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>N : number of vector entires with yi in output vector</p>
<p>yi : predicted value</p>
<p>yi* : actual value</p>
<p>𝛼 : learning rate</p>
<p>𝜽j : input</p>
<p>This will cause the weight parameters to be updated. When a large amount of data is used this can cause the weights to increase or decrease dramatically creating a problem known as vanishing or exploding gradients. When this occurs the weights will either be extremely close to zero or extremely large, which may be represented by a NaN value. An example when large amounts of data may be used is NER in which the context of previous words and characters is relevant. To mitigate an exploding or vanishing gradient long short-term memory (LSTM) cells may be used within the hidden layer. LSTM cells make use of three gates. An input gate, a forget gate, and an output gate. These gates use a sigmoid function which outputs a value between zero and one. Zero blocks all information and one allows all information through. The input gate determines which information is stored in the cell. The forget gate determines which information will be discarded. The output gate provides the activation for the final output. The sigmoid function is given below along with a general equation for the gates. When using LSTMs the weights and biases are the same among every iteration. This is so the RNN model can be applied to data of varying lengths.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cho2019BiomedNER">(<a href="#ref-Cho2019BiomedNER" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Cho2019BiomedNER?</strong></a>)</span></p>
<p>Sigmoid<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{f(x)} = {1/(1+e^{-x})}\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>General gate equation<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{g}_i = 𝝈(w[h_{i-1}, x_i] + b)\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>x : input</p>
<p>𝝈 : sigmoid function</p>
<p>w : weight</p>
<p>h : information of i-th iteration</p>
<p>b : bias</p>
<p>LSTMs have a cell state that is the result of the gates and a few other calculations. This state is what provides the cell with its “memory” which is very useful in NER when the memory of what was written or previously said can determine what should come next in a sentence. The other equations used besides sigmoid are shown below.</p>
<p>Possible cell state at i-th iteration<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{c}_i^*=tanh(w[h_{i-1}, x_i] + b)\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>Cell state<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{c}_i = (forget gate * c_{i-1}) + (input gate * c_i^* )\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>Output<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{h}_i = (output gate * tanh(c_i))\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>tanh<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{f(x)} = (e^x - e^{-x})/(e^x + e^{-x})\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>tanh : activation function</p>
<p>These equations determine which information is passed through the cell and the ultimate state of the cell at the present iteration. The type of RNN used in NER is many-to-many RNN. This type of RNN uses each word as an input to build the state (the context) of the model. This is what can be subsequently used in making predictions.</p>
</section>
<section id="transformer-model-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformer-model-1">2.2 Transformer Model</h2>
<p>The Transformers model has a unique feature called the ‘attention mechanism.’ It helps the model make intelligent predictions by focusing on essential parts of the input. For example, when predicting the next word in ‘I have a pet ___,’ the attention mechanism considers the context (the word ‘pet’) to make a better guess, like ‘dog’ or ‘cat.’ It’s like the model knows which words deserve extra attention! ! Let’s look at the two most important algorithms for the attention mechanism, Scaled Dot-Product Attention formula, and the Single (Masked) Self- or Cross-Attention Head Formula <span class="citation" data-cites="phuong2022formal">(<a href="#ref-phuong2022formal" role="doc-biblioref">Phuong and Hutter 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Scaled Dot-Product Attention formula<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V\)</span><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Q: Query matrix (requests for information).</p></li>
<li><p>K: Key matrix (used to calculate relevance).</p></li>
<li><p>V: Value matrix (actual content to retrieve).</p></li>
<li><p>d_k: Dimension of the query/key vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Softmax (...): Function to normalize attention scores.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this formula, the attention mechanism allows a model to “pay attention” to specific parts of input data. The attention scores are calculated using queries (Q) and keys (K). The scores are normalized using Softmax , producing attention weights. The output is a weighted sum of value vectors (V), where the weights represent the importance of each value for each query. This mechanism is popular in tasks like machine translation to focus on relevant words.</p></li>
<li><p>The Single (Masked) Self- or Cross-Attention Head Formula <span class="math inline">\(\begin{align*}\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) &amp;= \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top + \text{Mask}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \\\end{align*}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Q: Query matrix (requests for information).</p></li>
<li><p>K: Key matrix (used to calculate relevance).</p></li>
<li><p>V: Value matrix (actual content to retrieve).</p></li>
<li><p>d_k: Dimension of the query/key vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Mask: Matrix to prevent attention to specific tokens (e.g., future tokens).</p></li>
<li><p>Softmax (...): Function to normalize attention scores.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this formula, the attention uses queries (Q) and keys (K) to calculate attention scores. An optional mask (Mask) is added to scores to prevent attending to specific tokens (e.g., in language modeling, future tokens are masked). Scores are normalized using Softmax, producing attention weights. The output is a weighted sum of value vectors (V), representing the importance of each value for each query. Masking is useful for sequence-to-sequence tasks and autoregressive models.</p>

<pre><code>Text: While bismuth compounds (Pepto-Bismol) decreased the number of bowel movements in those with travelers' diarrhea, they do not decrease the length of illness.[91] Anti-motility agents like loperamide are also effective at reducing the number of stools but not the duration of disease.[8] These agents should be used only if bloody diarrhea is not present.[92]

Diosmectite, a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay, is effective in alleviating symptoms of acute diarrhea in children,[93] and also has some effects in chronic functional diarrhea, radiation-induced diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.[45] Another absorbent agent used for the treatment of mild diarrhea is kaopectate.

Racecadotril an antisecretory medication may be used to treat diarrhea in children and adults.[86] It has better tolerability than loperamide, as it causes less constipation and flatulence.[94]</code></pre>

<p>The Transformer model needed to be deployed in a Google Colab Repo because our computers did not have the power to train the transformer model when running out of a CPU. We get the following results which are good besides the eval_loss with over 31%. The hyperparameters were modified by increasing the epochs from 3 to 5 and 5 to 10, but the loss decreased to 25%. Precision and accuracy did not improve. The best approach to reduce the loss is to get more data. We could not find the more annotated dataset for NER in health. In Google Colab, a Hardware accelerator (GPU) was used to increase the training speed, and it worked. The link for further review is provided <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qKpXd2sP-Iesi76W-232hVUPkl9zvl5s?usp=sharing">Google Colab Code</a></p>

<p>Using the dataframe created from the transformer model a vocabulary of words and labels was created and then converted into indices. The sequences are then padded to a maximum length and then converted to one-hot encoded vectors. A one-hot encoded vector is a binary vector in which the label is encoded as 1 and everything else that is not the label is encoded as 0. This is necessary to train the model with tensorflow and recurrent neural networks.</p>

<h1><strong>6 Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p><strong><em>[This is a working conclusion]</em></strong></p>
<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key NLP task that involves identifying named entities in text. With advances in deep learning and large availability of computational resources, methods based on deep learning have demonstrated obvious advantages over traditional methods and have become mainstream in the NER field <span class="citation" data-cites="liu2021Hybrid">(<a href="#ref-liu2021Hybrid" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>liu2021Hybrid?</strong></a>)</span>. Deep learning techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the Transformer Model, are clearly effective in NER Tasks. RNNs, including LSTMs, excel at processing sequences and capturing context, while the Transformer model is known for its self-attention mechanism and efficient parallel processing. Both architectures contribute to advancing NER, and the choice between them depends on the specific NLP problem. In the NLP problem in this paper it can be seen that the RNN model has a higher accuracy than the transformer model, so the RNN model would be the preferred method to use in NER practices. This conclusion coicides with <span class="citation" data-cites="yadav2019survey">(<a href="#ref-yadav2019survey" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>yadav2019survey?</strong></a>)</span>, who agreed that neural network models generally outperform feature-engineered models. As deep learning research progresses, we anticipate further advancements in NER performance using these techniques.</p>
