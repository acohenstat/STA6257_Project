    "Creating and using a Bayesian network involves several steps, from defining the problem to performing inference. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:\n",
    "Define the Variables and Structure:\n",
    "- Identify the variables in your domain and determine the dependencies between them.\n",
    "- Create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent variables and edges represent conditional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs):\n",
    "- For each node (variable), define the CPD, which describes the probability of the node given its parents in the graph.\n",
    "- CPDs can be represented as tables (for discrete variables) or functions (for continuous variables).\n",
    "- Construct the Bayesian Network:\n",
    "- Combine the defined structure and CPDs to form the Bayesian network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validate the Model:\n",
    "- Ensure that the network is a valid probabilistic model, meaning the sum of probabilities in the CPDs should be 1.\n",
    "- Check for consistency and correctness of the network structure and CPDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference:\n",
    "- Use inference algorithms to compute posterior probabilities of variables given evidence.\n",
    "- Common inference methods include variable elimination, belief propagation, and sampling methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning:\n",
    "- If you have data, you can learn the structure and parameters of the Bayesian network from the data.\n",
    "- Structure learning involves determining the network structure from the data.\n",
    "- Parameter learning involves estimating the CPDs given the network structure and data."
